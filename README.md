# MathSlides

This tool was created for the series of articles called "Math is not required for UI development". Its main purpose was to generate a series of png images with graphs, matrices, and texts in the style of the school desk. Feel free to fork it and use it for your lectures too.

## Development

This tool is written in modern JavaScript with ES6 modules. You need to use a server to make it work. Any server is good, for example, you can use the http-server from NPM, it's nice a small:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sfi0zy/math-slides.git
cd math-slides
npm i
npx http-server
```
